#Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

#Tuple items are indexed with the first item having an index of [0], the second item has an index of [1] etc.

#The Tuple is immutable (ie: unchangeable), meaning that we can not change, add, and remove items in a tuple after it has been created.

#A Tuple may contain multiple different DataTypes include integers, strings, floats, booleans, lists and objects

#Tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by a comma inside round brackets ()
